mileston 4 for the failed regression model

i chose linear regression because we didnt really learn other prediction models 

it was all working fine until model.predict

ive never seen an error with shape mismatch and its still confusing how the mismatch even happened

i made sure the input and output features to fit into the model have the shapes i want

that is all i can do for now

im gussing the reason is because the data itself doesnt show regression

so even though the code ran successfully the data didnt really 'fit' the model

i mentioned this in a section in milestone 5 but one takeaway would be

not to be so confident with things that are unexpected of a model's capability
