## idea 1
### data visualization for taylor swift album sales
i have a dataset from another class with 1041 entries for the album sales based on cities
the data is in google sheets
with this project i need to extract the data with formats from google sheets
i would need to sort the list and organize the dictionary

## idea 2
### prediction model for the color of the year
i saw a dataset of skintone colors on kaggle for fashion use
not sure if this is possible because pantone decides color of the year based on many factors
the training data would be the rgb for past colors of the year
maybe a pattern in the rgb valeus would pop out
and the model could be used to predict the next one from previous data
this model wouldnt be accurate but it seems fun
